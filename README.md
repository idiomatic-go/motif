# motif 

Motif was inspired by the challenges of developing Go applications. Determining the patterns, or motifs, that need to be employed, is critical for writing clear idiomatic Go code. This YouTube video [Edward Muller - Go Anti-Patterns][emuller], does an excellent job of framing idiomatic go. 
[Robert Griesemer - The Evolution of Go][rgriesemer] also presents an important analogy between Go packages and LEGOÂ® bricks. Reviewing the Go standard
library packaging structure provides a blueprint for an application architecture, and underscores how essential package design is for idiomatic Go. 

With the release of Go generics, a new paradigm has emerged: [templates][tutorialspoint]. Templates are not new, having been available in  C++ since 1991, and have become a standard through the work of teams like [boost][boost]. I prefer the term templates over generics, as templates are a paradigm, and generics connotes a class of implementations. What follows is a description of the packages in Motif, highlighting specific patterns and template implementations.
